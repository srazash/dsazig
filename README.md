# Data Structures & Algorithms in Zig

Following [The Primeagen's excellent series on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).

The repo will be a self-contained Zig executable project (`zig init-exe`) using Zig 11.0, different data structures and algorithms will be logically organised into subdirectories imported into `main.zig` and executed for testing and demonstration purposes.
