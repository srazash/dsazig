# Data Structures & Algorithms in Zig

Following [The Primeagen's excellent series on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).

The repo will be a self-contained Zig executable project (`zig init-exe`) using Zig 0.13, different data structures and algorithms will be logically organised into subdirectories imported into `main.zig` and executed and tested for demonstration purposes.
